## About

The Slightly Improved™ Gameplay is a collection of small changes and additions to the game interface.

1. Two new options in the player's context menu (right-click player's name in chat):
    - Send Mail: open the send mail screen with the recipient field filled.
    - Copy in Chat: easier than having to type someone's name.
2. Show periodic warnings (like the one for damaged gear) when:
    - You have trash items in your inventory that should be sold to a vendor.
    - You have stolen items that should be fenced or laundered.
3. Allows you o change the default selected option for new mail: Send Money or C.O.D.
4. Rearrange equipped gear slots in the inventory screen to take less space.
5. Filter Wayshrines out when you zoom out to the world view in the game map. (Thanks to [Biki](http://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=877)!)
6. Check your local time with the slash commands /clock or /time.

You can enabled or disable each feature individually via the add-on settings menu.
