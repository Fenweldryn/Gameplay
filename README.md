## About

The Slightly Improved™ add-ons provides many great improvements to the game in a categorized manner, where each add-on cares for a single feature or aspect of the game. Now there're a variety of small changes that don't fit in the previous add-ons and wouldn't make up for its own category. They are:

1. Add two new options to the player's context menu (right-click player's name in chat):
    - Send Mail: open the new mail screen with the recipient autocompleted.
    - Copy in Chat: easier than having to type someone's name.
2. Add a clock to the Performance Meter (where the game displays FPS and/or latency) that can be enabled/disasbled by the slash command /clock.
3. The game already makes periodic warnings about damaged gear, this add-on extends this feature for:
    - Treasure or Trash items in your inventory that should be sold to a vendor.
    - Stolen items that should be fenced or laundered.
4. Set C.O.D. as the default new mail mode (you usually charge rather then give away).
